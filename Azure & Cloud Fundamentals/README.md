# Azure & Cloud Fundamentals

# Lucas’s Blog Based on Wordpress

## 1. Introduction
In fact, I had the idea to create a blog from a very early age, but its purpose was not to record my life, nor to make a profit by owning a website. My original intention was to make the blog a storage place of some technology stuff, like coding, because my memory is really bad.. From this perspective, my ideal blog is more about recording my own technical practice than personal life. Because of this, when I learned about cloud notes products like notion, I did not hesitate to choose cloud notes instead of personal blogs, because my original intention was to remind myself of forgetfulness, not to share on the Internet For everyone to study together.

This time, the non-tech branch of MSA needs to build a Wordpress blog. I have to say that it still evokes the mood in my heart a long time ago. Therefore I hope to take this opportunity to transplant some of the technical cloud notes I have recorded to my blog, and let the Internet witness my growth.

## 2. Current Issues and solutions

### 2.1 SEO

Issue:Not being searched by search engine.

Related Reason:SEO is becoming more and more inclined to user intent, rather than simply doing keyword optimization. With the iterative update of the major search engine algorithms, more and more websites are punished for keyword stuffing but low content quality. If you want to get a better search engine ranking, the most effective way to achieve this goal is to target the keywords users search for, to solve specific problems in specific fields, and build valuable, high-quality keywords around these keywords content.

Unfortunately, search engine optimization is much more than finding keywords and generating content. You need to make sure that search engines can index and crawl your site, use titles and descriptions optimized for search engine search results, use key keywords and related keywords correctly, optimize your site performance, and more.

Solution: Using SEO plugin to improve search engine rankings.

### 2.2 Site Speed

Issue:Guess what to do if the website is accessed slowly? No one visits it. Loneliness spread, and soon, no one remembered the name of the site. It will not show up in a good search engine ranking position. It's a bit dramatic, but this is true. Slow websites will not be loved. Therefore, you need to find a way to optimize your WordPress website. The easiest way is through the cache plugin.

Related reason:First, the visitor ’s browser contacts your web server to obtain data about your website. Your visitors can access your website from anywhere. It may be one mile away from your web server or halfway away from the web server. Secondly, your WordPress will contact the website database where the website is installed. Third, the database compiles the data, converts it to an HTML page, and then sends it back to the user. Each time the user refreshes the page, the entire process repeats itself. Your user's browser requests all images again, and whenever he visits your website, the data in the MySQL database will be recalled. If your visitor ’s browser stores the image on their local hard drive and WordPress saves the data obtained from the database to you to make any changes, what would you think? This is exactly what WordPress caching does. Caching is the process of recovering the acquired data to speed up the WordPress website. Caching can minimize the number of data transfers between the visitor and the database. It reduces the number of requests and ultimately reduces the website load time.

Solution: The easiest way is through the cache plugin.

### 2.3 User Behavior Analysis

Issue:Not knowing the details of website visitors

Related reason:Website analytics can help you get detailed information about your website visitors. Here are some things you can learn from website analysis:

1. The number of visitors to your website.
2. Which sources will send you traffic. For example, search engines, social media, advertising or referral links.
3. What is your most popular webpage?
4. The actions that users perform on your website.

Solution:An excellent WordPress analysis solution can easily present all these data understanding reports. This enables you to make informed decisions about your website, which can ultimately help you get more traffic, customers and sales.

## 3. Plugin Comparison and Implementation

### 3.1 SEO

#### 3.1.1 Yoast SEO

Yoast SEO is one of the top two SEO plugins available for WordPress. Another plugin is called All-in-One SEO. Yoast has been downloaded more than 40 million times and is being used by more than 7 million websites. It has a free version and a premium version, and currently the free version has a 4.9 star rating (out of 5 stars). This rating was generated by more than 20,000 reviews.

Yoast was created by Joost de Valk in 2010. Prior to developing the WordPress SEO plugin, Joost accumulated extensive experience in IT and coding, and served as an SEO consultant for many years. Today, it is supported by a team of developers, designers, and marketers, and even sponsored WordCamps (WordPress Conventions) as a way to give back to the community.

The free version has following key features:

1. XML site maps – XML site maps are not necessarily necessary for SEO, but they can help search engines find the most important pages on your site. Usually, search engines will find the most important pages through internal links on your website, and you are responsible for the internal link structure. The site map makes this process much simpler, and Yoast can generate a site map for you.
2. Title tags and meta descriptions-Which elements of the website do the titles and page excerpts in the search results correspond to? The essence is the title tag and meta description of your website page. Yoast allows you to set title tags and meta descriptions for articles to change how they are displayed in search engines. These are different from the titles and excerpts you see on the article page.
3. Snippet preview – When you edit the title tag and meta description of an article, Yoast displays a snippet preview, allowing you to view the article ’s display in the search engine.
4. SEO analysis — It is difficult to understand whether the main keywords are used correctly. Fortunately, Yoast comes with an SEO analyzer, which allows you to enter keywords and let the tool analyze your content to rate it.
5. Content Analysis-Marked as "Readability" in Yoast, this tool analyzes your content to determine the difficulty of reading. Readability is not a direct ranking factor, but it can help reduce the bounce rate of your website and increase the length of visitors ’visits. If too many visitors find your content difficult to read, they will leave, which indirectly tells the search engine that your content is problematic. However, the debate about whether readability needs to be optimized remains.
6. Internal link analysis-your internal link structure can help you direct Google's crawler program to content that you want to rank higher than others. Yoast comes with an analysis tool that can help you optimize the internal link structure.
7. Cornerstone Content Label-Cornerstone Content Label is a dormant but growing SEO strategy. Basically, you will find three to five keywords that you want to rank the entire website, and build a long format (10000 words) page for them. This strategy relies on a strong internal link structure to help optimize the ranking of these keywords on your website by attracting search engine crawlers to visit cornerstone content pages. Yoast allows you to mark specific content as basic content and helps you optimize the internal link structure accordingly.
8. Integrate Google Webmaster Tools -404 pages and other errors to reduce Google's crawling frequency of your website. Google webmaster tools help you quickly understand search engine crawler access errors and fix them when they occur.
9. Permission control – Content and SEO analysis tools are useful for blogs, but you may not want your authors to be able to edit Yoast SEO ’s entire site settings. This function can control the permissions of the plug-in.

Compared with the All-in-One SEO, the free version of Yoast is rich enough for a novice webmaster. So I chose the Yoast SEO plugin to improve the search engine ranking for my blog.

### 3.2 Cache Management

The two major contenders for the best WordPress cache plugin are:

1. W3 Total Cache: A feature-heavy solution, featuring a huge array of settings for meticulously configuring your site’s caching.
2. WP Super Cache: A more simplified but no less powerful option, which is well-suited to high-traffic websites.

#### 3.2.1 Introduction to WP Super Cache 

WP Super Cache was created by Automattic, the company behind WordPress. It lets you generate static HTML files that your web server can display to your website’s visitors. This is a far quicker alternative to processing WordPress PHP scripts, which can be costly as well as time consuming.

WP Super Cache has three methods for serving cached files. ‘Expert’, the fastest method, can help ensure that your site performs well under pressure from heavy traffic (making it useful for scalability). The ‘Simple’ method isn’t quite as fast, but enables files to be served with sections that remain dynamic. The last method, ‘WP-Cache caching’, caters to logged-in users. It ensures that they receive reliable performance when performing actions on your site.

Since WP Super Cache is simple, relatively lightweight, and easy to configure, it’s a good fit for those who are relatively new to WordPress. It can also sync with your Content Delivery Network (CDN), which means you can further boost your site’s speed.

#### 3.2.2 Introduction to W3 Total Cache

Just like WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache can smoothly integrate with your CDN. However, it also saves bandwidth by minifying and compressing your site’s files. In fact, this plugin’s versatile compression and rendering settings can improve overall speed and performance by 10x. It also contains features to significantly lessen download times on your site, further enhancing the user experience in the process.

W3 Total Cache differs from WP Super Cache in that it is web host agnostic. This means it can serve as a reliable caching solution, regardless of your hosting provider. By comparison, WP Super Cache functions better on low-powered servers.

Due to its multiple settings for minimizing JavaScript and Custom Style Sheet (CSS) files, as well as its object caching capabilities, W3 Total Cache is better suited to more advanced users. It’s also a good fit if you’re developing a WordPress site that is largely targeting a mobile user demographic, as it supports caching for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).

I would not write too much here about the detailed comparison between the two cache management tools. Finally I chose to use WP Super Cache due to its lightweight, simple, reliable, and free caching solution. Detailed comparison can be found [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-super-cache-vs-w3-total-cache).

#### 3.2.3 WP Super Cache Implementation
![](https://github.com/ripenedcat/msa-machinelearning/raw/master/Azure%20%26%20Cloud%20Fundamentals/png/9.png)
##### 3.1 Easy tab
First go to the general tab and turn on the cache function.

##### 3.2 Advanced Tab
My personal setting method is shown below. The basic method is to open all the options recommended by the system, and set the cache refresh to once a day to improve access speed.

![](https://github.com/ripenedcat/msa-machinelearning/raw/master/Azure%20%26%20Cloud%20Fundamentals/png/10.png)
![](https://github.com/ripenedcat/msa-machinelearning/raw/master/Azure%20%26%20Cloud%20Fundamentals/png/11.png)
![](https://github.com/ripenedcat/msa-machinelearning/raw/master/Azure%20%26%20Cloud%20Fundamentals/png/12.png)


By default, cache is based on the user access driver, and the pre-cache makes the user have not yet accessed, you can first generate a cache file. The pre-cache page operates as follows, select 0 minutes, that is, do not refresh the pre-cache file. If there are too many blog posts, frequent refreshes will affect system performance. In particular, web hosting is not recommended.

![](https://github.com/ripenedcat/msa-machinelearning/raw/master/Azure%20%26%20Cloud%20Fundamentals/png/13.png)

It is not recommended to configure the CDN interface, but if your website server is located in a remote place, such as China, it is best to configure the local CDN to increase the speed of world access, such as Alibaba Cloud.
Other settings basically do not need to be changed, so I won't repeat them one by one here.

### 3.3 Analytics plugin

#### 3.3.1 Introduction to MonsterInsight

Is there a reason not to use Google Analytics? MonsterInsight is such a plugin that integrates Google Analytics. Before we delve into the Google Analytics installation process, we need to take a moment to study why it is recommended to use the MonsterInsights plugin instead of manually analyzing the installation.

Although manually installing Google Analytics allows you to collect basic traffic statistics such as sessions, pageviews, bounce rate, etc., the disadvantage is that it cannot fully utilize the full potential of Google Analytics. For example, if you need to use more Google Analytics tracking features such as download tracking, link tracking, form tracking, e-commerce, tracking, etc., you must manually customize the code for each instance. There is no doubt that if you are not a developer or an analysis expert, this may be tedious. It ’s possible that even a slight error can distort the entire Google Analytics tracking, which means that the data you get from your Google Analytics account is incorrect, which can lead you to make the wrong decision for your business.

On the other hand, MonsterInsights can easily install Google Analytics with just a few clicks. MonsterInsights is the most popular WordPress Google Analytics plugin in existence. To enable enhanced tracking, you only need a few clicks or install the appropriate plugin. Since you never need to touch any line of code, you can save your precious time during the entire installation process.

#### 3.3.2 MonsterInsight Installation
##### a) Creating Google Analytics account
1. Click here to go to Google Analytics.
2. Click Create an account.
3. Once you have signed in to your Google account, click Access Google Analytics.
##### b) Link your Google Analytics account to MonsterInsight
Complete the login and binding of Google Analytics account according to the Monster Insight page prompt. Since I have completed this part, there is no picture guide.

##### c) Look at your website overview
You can see your website data of sessions, pageviews, average session duration and bounce rate.
